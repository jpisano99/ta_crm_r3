In order to load CSV files directly in MySql using the load data local infile command:

    path_to_file = "c:/my_csv.csv"
    sql = "load data local infile '" + path_to_file +\
          "' into table bookings" +\
          " fields terminated by ','" +\
          " enclosed by '\"'" +\
          " escaped by ''" +\
          " lines terminated by '\\r\\n'"
    print(sql)
    db.engine.execute(sql)


Change the MySql SERVER .ini file:
    C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\my.ini
# Make this change to ALLOW local_infile to work:
    [mysqld]
    local_infile=1

For the CLIENT Side
    set app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI']
    mysql+mysqlconnector://root:YOURPASSWORD@localhost:3306/test_db?charset=utf8&allow_local_infile=true
